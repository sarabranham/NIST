# NIST
Creating flexible/readable symbolic and numeric models of microwave circuits that can interface with existing code.
The short term goal is to read in noisy data sets and fit them to one of the models to provide an
initial approximation for what the S parameters should be.
Additionally, we hope to extend this into a GUI that can easily display different parameters and let the user see
what the code is doing - in terms of approximating realistic values for c0, c1, l0, c1, etc., which may not be given.
